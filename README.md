Week 5 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment
This project is part of my Python assignments for Week 5, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

📁 File
oop.assignment.py — Main Python file demonstrating OOP concepts.
📚 Concepts Covered
Classes and Objects
Inheritance
Method Overriding
Polymorphism
📌 Description
The assignment contains examples of:

A Phone class and subclasses like OPPO and iPhone.
A Vehicle class with subclasses such as Car and Airplane.
Demonstrations of calling subclass-specific methods like taking photos and flying.
It prints output based on object behavior, showing how different classes inherit and modify behavior from their parent classes.

🖥️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

python oop.assignment.py
